# IMDB Movie Fetcher

A Python script that fetches movie data from IMDB using the Cinemagoer library and enriches the existing movie metadata with IMDB information.

## Overview

This script:
1. Reads movie titles from a CSV file containing movie metadata
2. Searches IMDB for each movie title
3. Retrieves detailed information about each movie (ratings, cast, runtime, etc.)
4. Saves the IMDB data to a separate CSV file
5. Joins the original metadata with the IMDB data to create an enhanced dataset

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Python libraries: 
  - imdbpy (Cinemagoer)
  - pandas
  - tqdm
  - csv
  - json
  - logging

## Installation

Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install imdbpy pandas tqdm
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the script with default settings:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Input/Output

### Input
- Uses `../../data/individual_files/metadata_modifications.csv` as the input file
- This file should contain movie metadata with at least `movie_name` and `id` columns

### Output
- Generates `../../data/individual_files/imdb.csv` with IMDB data for each movie
- Creates a joined file `../../data/individual_files/metadata_modifications_imdb.csv` that combines the original metadata with IMDB data
- Maintains a `.completed.json` file to track processed movie IDs for efficient resumability
- Logs activity to `imdb_fetch.log`

## IMDB Data Retrieved

The script extracts the following information for each movie:
- IMDB ID
- Title
- Release year
- Genres
- IMDB rating
- Number of votes
- Directors
- Actors (top 10)
- Runtime
- Countries of origin
- Languages
- Plot overview
- Release date
- Writers
- Production studios
- Poster URL

## Features

- **Resumable Processing**: Uses a completion tracking system to resume from where it left off
- **Rate Limiting**: Includes delays between requests to avoid hitting IMDB's rate limits
- **Duplicate Avoidance**: Skips movies that have already been processed
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging for tracking progress and debugging

## Notes

- The script uses the first search result from IMDB, which may not always be the correct movie. Manual verification of the results may be necessary.
- Processing a large number of movies may take significant time due to rate limiting.
