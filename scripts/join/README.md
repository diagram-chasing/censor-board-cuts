# Join Script

This script joins multiple datasets to create the final consolidated `data.csv` file for the Censor Board Cuts project.

## Purpose

The join script merges three key datasets:
1. `data/individual_files/metadata_modifications.csv` - Contains film metadata and modification details
2. `data/raw/imdb.csv` - Contains IMDB data for films
3. `data/raw/llm.csv` - Contains LLM-generated analysis of censorship content

The merged dataset is saved as `data/data.csv`, following the schema documented in `data/README.md`.

## Usage

To run the join script:

```bash
python scripts/join/main.py
```

## Implementation Details

The script performs the following operations:
1. Reads the three input CSV files
2. Merges them using the `certificate_id` as the common key
3. Performs left joins to ensure all records from the metadata_modifications file are preserved
4. Saves the combined dataset to `data/data.csv`

## Integration with Main Pipeline

This script is typically run as step 6 in the main data pipeline. To run only this step:

```bash
python scripts/main.py --skip-categories --skip-certificates --skip-processing --skip-imdb --skip-llm
```
